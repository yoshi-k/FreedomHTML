<h1>FreedomHTML Working Draft</h1>
<h2>1. Foreword (informative)</h2>
About FreedomHTML:
<ul>
 <li>why the FreedomHTML initiative was created
 <li>how the FreedomHTML initiative is organized
 <li>how the FreedomHTML profile specification has been developed
     and approved
</ul>
<h2>2. Introduction (informative)</h2>
<ul>
 <li>What is HTML
  <ul>
   <li>20 years success open standards story
   <li>What is a profile specification
   <li>Informative vs. normative text in a specification
   <li>Why two conformance classes (Strict and Experimental)
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2>3. Motivation (informative)</h2>
<ul>
 <li>“Hollyweb” petition against DRM support in HTML5
     http://www.defectivebydesign.org/no-drm-in-html5
     which W3C has promptly chosen to ignore; the concerned draft spec
     has been advanced to “First Public Working Draft” status on May 10.
</ul>
<h2>4. Fundamental rights and ICT standards (informative)</h2>
In view of the FreedomHTML work being motivated by a dispute around DRM,
it is reasonable to ask to what extent a consensus exists among democratic
societies about the relevant policy questions.
<p>
Certainly there is no consensus that what DRM proponents demand, namely
absolute control of how their publications may be used, would be
appropriate.
<p>
Copyright law gives them a lot of control, some think it's too
much control, others think it's too little. Some think that something
must be done to prevent Internet-based phenomena from eroding the
economic power of publishers; others think that as the Internet and
other technical developments make it much easier for people to create
and publish cultural goods, it is only appropriate for the economic
power of specialized publishing companies to diminish, and that
copyright law should be weakened correspondingly. In any case, the legal
situation in every jurisdiction is that there are limits to the scope
of legal control granted by law to copyright holders.
<p>
To a large extent, national copyright systems are shaped by the principles
of the Berne convention which have not been updated for the Internet age.
In the view of many people, the resulting laws are simply wrong (in a
variety of ways: morally wrong, violating human rights, and failing to
achieve the intended purpose) in the context of the Internet age.
<p>
These legal systems may therefore not be a good source of inspiration for
shaping and building the open web of the future.
<p>
Consequently, FreedomHTML aims to be guided directly by the relevant first
principles, in particular human rights and other fundamental rights, for
which there is a very broad consensus in democratic societies.

<h3>4.1 Relevant human rights</h3>
<ul>
  <li> right of peoples to self-determination (IECSR, Article 1;
       ICCPR, Article 1)
  <li> right to take part in cultural life (IECSR, Article 15(1a)).
  <li> right to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its
       applications (IECSR, Article 15(1b)).
   <ul>
    <li>This is violated by attempts to control what client-side
        application software is allowed to be used.
     <ul>
      <li>One mechanism for such control is when it is accepted for
          standards-essential patents to exist which are not made
          available to all in a non-discriminarory and royalty-free
          way.
      <li>All DRM systems that currently exist or have been seriously
          proposed have the same problem.
      <li>A historical example is that telecom companies were granted
          the ability to control what devices people were allowed to
          connect to their telephone lines.
     </ul>
   </ul>
  <li> right of authors to benefit from the protection of the moral
       and material interests resulting from their scientific, literary
       or artistic productions (IECSR, article 15(1c)).
  <li> states shall take the necessary steps for the conservation,
       the development and the diffusion of science and culture
       (IECSR, Article 15(2)).
  <li> states shall respect the freedom indispensable for scientific
       research and creative activity (IECSR, Article 15(3)). 
  <li> right to personal privacy, right to protection from the risk
       of violation of personal privacy (ICCPR, Article 17).
  <li> right to protection of correspondence (ICCPR, Article 17).
  <li> right to protection from unlawful attacks on one's honour and
       reputation (ICCPR, Article 17).
  <li> freedom of thought, conscience and religion (ICCPR, Article 18).
  <li> freedom of opinion and freedom of expression (ICCPR, Article 19).
  <li> cultural freedoms of minorities (Article 27). 
  <li> right of persons with disabilities to participate equally, and
       obligation of states to ensure that this is possible (Convention
       on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, see in particular
       Article 9)
</ul>
<h3>4.2 Other relevant fundamental rights</h3>
     (rights which are also fundamentally important to having a
     viable ecosystem in the Internet age, even though these rights
     are of a lesser importance than human rights, and they are also
     not protected in international law at the level of human rights)
<ul>
 <li>right to privacy of business secrets
</ul>
<h3>4.3 Threats to human rights and other fundamental rights</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Large-scale surveillance by governments
   <ul>
    <li>PRISM (large-scale surveillance by the U.S. government directed
        against the world population)
   </ul>
  <li> “Great Firewalls” and persecution of dissidents by totalitarian
       countries
</ul>
<h3>4.4 What the Internet techno-ecosystem as a whole should be like in
    order to appropriately address these threats</h3>
<ul>
  <li> software for which the source code is not available and which
       cannot be forked in inherently untrustworthy
   <ul>
    <li> therefore, it is not acceptable if any component of the
         Internet-based information and communication system is not
         fully accessible using FOSS
     <ul>
      <li> if something cannot be implemented in a GPLv3 compatible
           way, there is probably a reason why it cannot be implemented
           in FOSS
      <li> GPLv3 conforming implementability is therefore a key “open
           web” requirement
     </ul>
   </ul>
  <li> since it is a human rights violation to take action to deny the
       people in some country the ability to fully participate in the
       globalized, Internet-based part of culture, it is not acceptable
       to create a techno-ecosystem for cultural goods that is based on
       a concept of making content available only to people in specific
       countries
</ul>

<h3>4.5 Conclusion: The right to fully control your computer</h3>
<h3>4.6 Consequences for ICT standards in general</h3>
<ul>
  <li> importance of strict “open standards” principles
   <ul>
    <li>GPLv3 conforming implementation must be possible
    <li>strictness: The specification shall be formulated precisely and 
         sufficiently strictly, so that it ensures interoperability of
         conforming implementations within the scope of its stated
         objectives.
   </ul>
  <li> if for a feature there are no known significant use cases that
       are in accordance with the principle of fully upholding and
       implementing all human rights, then the feature shall not be
       included in any standards
</ul>
<h3>4.6 Consequences for “web” standards specifically</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Web standards need to promote specifically the “open web”, i.e. web technologies which can
     be fully implemented in Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).
</ul>
<h2>5. Definitions (normative)</h2>

<h2>6. Conformance (normative)</h2>
<h3>6.1 Strict FreedomHTML website conformance</h3>
<h3>6.2 Strict FreedomHTML browser conformance</h3>

<h3>6.4 Experimental FreedomHTML browser conformance</h3>
<h2>7. Assertion of Conformance (normative)</h2>
<h2>8. Features of Strict FreedomHTML (normative)</h2>
<h2>9. Features of Experimental FreedomHTML (normative)</h2>
<ul>
 <li>HTML5 Image Description Extension (longdesc)
</ul>
<h2>10. Analysis of unacceptable features (informative)</h2>
<h3>10.1 Encrypted Media Extensions (EME)</h3>
<ul>
 <li>EME is not about access control to content. It is about trying to control
     usage of content after it has been accessed and downloaded to a user's
     computer. That violates the “right to fully control your computer” principle.
     (By contrast, access control on a server, about who is granted access to a
     given data file is not contrary to the “right to fully control your computer”
     principle. Quite on the contrary, the “right to fully control your computer principle”
     principle implies that when you operate a server, you have the right to control who may use
     your server to download a given file.)
 <li>When, as clearly forseen as a possibility in the EME specification,
     the CDM bypasses the browser when Frames have been decrypted, that
     also bypasses interfaces to assistive technologies provided by the
     browser. Interfaces to assistive technologies might still be provided
     by the OS, but context information which the CDM can be make available to the
     interfaces to assistive technologies is limited by what information is
     available to the CDM in the first place. It would be better to implement the
     Interfaces to assistive technologies in the browser.
 <li>There is little reason for CDM providers not to require stringent
     “trusted platform module” based OS checking.
  <ul>
   <li>There is little reason for CDMs to be made available for FOSS
       operating system platforms.
    <ul>
     <li>threat to FOSS operating system platforms
      <ul>
       <li>contrary to W3C's stated principle “We should be able to access
           the web from any kind of hardware that can connect to the
           Internet” (W3C » Standards » Browsers and Authoring Tools - 
           http://www.w3.org/standards/agents/Overview.html )
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
 <li>in the absence of any stated use case for the “simple clear key
     decryption”, it can be expected that this would not be used in
     practice - likely this feature was added to the specification only
     to diffuse criticism about impatiblity with FOSS, but without any
     actual use cases, the presence of this feature in the specification
     cannot be expected to make the situation better
  <ul>
   <li>Therefore, in the context of the EME specification, the “simple
     clear key decryption” feature does not render the specification
     acceptable, even if that feature could be implemented in FOSS.
  </ul>
 <li>a CDM implementation that meets the expectations of DRM proponents
     who are content providers must necessarily contain secrets that are
     intended to be kept secret for as long as possible, however
     closing source code for the CDM implementation would make it rather
     easy to extract those secrets
  <ul>
   <li>contrary to the principle that the specification should provide
       sufficient information to achieve interoperability
   <li>contrary to the principle that it must be possible to participate
       in every aspect of Internet based information and communication
       systems while using FOSS
  </ul>
 <li>There are known patent claims which cast significant doubt on the
     implementability of the EME features without infringing the patent
     or obtaining a patent license (which is not likely to be available
     to be compatbile with the requirement of FOSS implementability).
 <li>If content is encrypted so that a “virus scanner” can't look at it,
     what prevents the content from containing malware?
  <ul>
   <li>Content malware might exploit bugs in the browser's or operating system's
       rendering system to compromise the user's computer.
   <li>When, as foreseen in EME specification, the CDM is able to access
       an operating system's “hardware protected media pipeline”, that means
       that software which is explicitly not under the control of the user
       is granted significant low-level access. This raises concerns about
       the creation of a new vector for problems like screen locks and display
       corruption.
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2>11. Answers to counterarguments (informative)</h2>
<ul>
 <li>The open web is strong enough and innovative enough to win against
     the current trend of app-ification. There are challenges in that
     area, yes, but they can be overcome without sacrificing any of the
     Web's and W3C's integrity to the idols of the DRM proponents.
     Openness is very powerful. This power of openness is what has
     brought the DRM proponents to the point of being willing to work
     through W3C. The key problem is that if W3C goes along with this,
     and no effective actions are taken outside of W3C to counteract
     what I see as the likely influence of a W3C EME specification, then
     the power of the open web is essentially put into the hands of the
     DRM proponents to use as they please. That would be a very serious
     and significant shift of power.
</ul>
<h2>12. Fundamental “democracy deficit” problem (informative)</h2>
 <li>A key problem here is that W3C is organized as an industry
     consortium so that a small number of industry members can --in total
     disregard of negative social consequences for the rest of the world--
     essentially unilaterally decide that a web standard of a certain type
     will be created. This situation needs to be challenged.
 <li>Likely root problem that causes much of the lack of progress in many
     Internet governance debates: Lack of widely used and widely
     understood methods for making a reasonably complete analysis of
     systemically complex decision situations, and for having a reasonable
     discourse about such analysis and proposed conclusions.
 <li>Human rights implementation is primarily the responsibility of
     governments, but governments are currently ill-equipped to do so
     effectively.
  <ul>
   <li>We wouldn't want to trade the “Hollyweb” for a “Balkanized web”.
  </ul>
